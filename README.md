# SWEN 262 Group C LBMS

* This is our team's repository for Engineering of Software Subsystems (SWEN 262) at the Rochester Institute of Technology

* Our team was tasked with the responsibility to design and implement the Library Book Management System (LBMS). The LBMS is Book Worm Libraryâ€™s (BWL) system for providing book information to users, tracking library visitor statistics for a library statistics report, tracking borrowedchecked out books, and allowing the library inventory to be updated. It is the server-side system that provides an API used by client-side interfaces that BWL employees use.
