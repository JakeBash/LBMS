# SWEN 262 Group C LBMS

* This is our team's repository for Engineering of Software Subsystems (SWEN 262) at the Rochester Institute of Technology

* Our team was tasked with the responsibility to design and implement the Library Book Management System (LBMS). The LBMS is Book Worm Libraryâ€™s (BWL) system for providing book information to users, tracking library visitor statistics for a library statistics report, tracking borrowedchecked out books, and allowing the library inventory to be updated. It is the server-side system that provides an API used by client-side interfaces that BWL employees use.

DISCLAIMERS AND INFO ON COMMANDS
* REMEMBER YOUR USER ID, Copy to clipboard, you wont get it back...
* The program is VERY FRAGILE. Be careful on imputting commands
* You must search the library store before attempting to buy
* If the command is supposed to have {}, then you must use {} for that field
even if that field is to be replaced by an astrix
    - ex: info,\*,{\*}; and not info,\*,\*;
    - The latter will crash the program
* Reports will generate for the beginning of time. Selecting a time interval
will be implemented in a later release
* When borrowing, the ID is the ISBN and use squiggly brackets
    - ex: borrow,3333398140,{9780762755349};
* Many of the commands to not return a response upon error. This will
also be implemented in a later release
* It wasn't listed as a required command but Shutdown is a thing
    - the command is "shutdown;"
    - This hevily relies on Java's Serializable
* Partial commands Should work.
